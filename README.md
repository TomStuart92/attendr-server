## Introduction

This is the back end of our Makers Academy Final Project, Attendr. Attendr is an events driven dating platform which matches people based on events they are both interested in.

Backend is hosted on Heroku - [Link](http://www.attendr-server.herokuapp.com)    

This part of the application is built to serve our iOS, written in Swift. You can find the source code, and demo here:

## Other Information

This part of the project was relatively simple given our experience in using Node. We chose Node as we needed something fast, scalable and that we'd used before. This allowed us to focus on the swift application. The code in this repo, is well tested and certainly does the job it needs to do, but as it was not the focus of the two week project could use a full refactor.
